# Tehiru-Homework-assignment
The goal of this assignment is to develop a ROS2-based solution for autonomous navigation using a drone within the LiftOff simulator.
The drone should be capable of autonomously navigating to a target designated on the screen, all while remaining in flight.
The assignment will test your ability to integrate ROS2 with drone control systems, develop algorithms for target navigation, and ensure smooth, reliable flight behavior.
